**Mintcraft** is a modpack assembled in 1.16.4. While trying to stay true to the vanilla Minecraft experience, this modpack also introduces a new technical side of the game and expands on existing mechanics. Including staple mods such as *Immersive Engineering*, *Create*, *Minecolonies*, and *Pam's HarvestCraft 2*, we are trying to really capture the feel of what an enhanced vanilla Minecraft could be.
